Stuff that would be nice to have:

- symlinks to folders should be treated like folders, not files

- filter out empty folders?

  But what about nested empty folders?

- redirect commands?

  So you can run "git-annex add" in it, and not have it break stuff. Might be easier to do this via a git-annex wrapper, though.
